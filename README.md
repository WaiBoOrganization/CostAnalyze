# CostAnalyse
This is a plugin for Qgis. 
It's designed to calculate the shortest distance on a raster layer.

## Installation
Feel free to download these codes.
Add the folder to the `Python Plugin Path`. Open Qgis and it will appear in the `Plugin` menu. 
We are preparing to release our plugin to the public repository.

## Use Example

* Add a raster layer to the Qgis. Then select the raster layer as the cost layer.
* Click on the ‘+’  then click on the raster layer map to add a `Start Point` and a `End Point`.
* Select an algorithm and click on the `excute` button.
* The minimum cost and time cost will be shown below.


## Build-in Algorithms
The algorithms we implement include SPFA(and SLF, LLL, SLF and LLL), A*(A Star), Dijkstra.
